# Emotion-Detection
Overview
Emotion detection involves identifying human emotions from textual, audio, or visual data using machine learning and deep learning techniques. This project focuses on building a system to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and others, which has applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.

The project uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) for text-based emotion detection, and computer vision or audio processing for visual and audio-based detection. The aim is to create an efficient and accurate model capable of analyzing inputs and classifying emotions reliably.

Image/Video-Based Emotion Detection: Analyze facial expressions or gestures in images/videos to infer emotions.

Data Preprocessing:

Text: Clean text data by removing noise, stopwords, and punctuation.
Audio: Extract features such as MFCCs, pitch, and energy from speech signals.
Images: Use face detection and landmark extraction to focus on regions of interest.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize the distribution of emotions in the dataset.
Analyze correlations between features and emotions.
Identify patterns and trends in emotional expressions.
Model Training:

Images: Train CNNs or use pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or MobileNet for facial emotion detection.

Real-Time Prediction:
Text: Analyze and classify emotions in text input.
Audio: Detect emotions from recorded or live speech.
Images/Videos: Detect emotions from webcam feeds or image uploads.
Dataset
The project can use publicly available datasets for emotion detection based on the chosen modality:

Text-Based Datasets
Emotion Dataset for Text Classification (Kaggle):

URL: Emotion Dataset
Description: Contains text sentences labeled with emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
Number of Records: 20,000+ text samples.
